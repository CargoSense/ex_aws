  CreateHsm

  Creates an uninitialized HSM instance.

  There is an upfront fee charged for each HSM instance that you create with
  the `CreateHsm` operation. If you accidentally provision an HSM and want to
  request a refund, delete the instance using the `DeleteHsm` operation, go
  to the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/),
  create a new case, and select **Account and Billing Support**.

  <important> It can take up to 20 minutes to create and provision an HSM.
  You can monitor the status of the HSM with the `DescribeHsm` operation. The
  HSM is ready to be initialized when the status changes to `RUNNING`.
